        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>In this delightful dish, tender chicken is lightly coated with cornstarch and 
          seared to form a delicate crust, ideal for absorbing a vibrant sauce made 
          from spicy yellow curry paste, creamy peanut butter, and smooth mayo. Served 
          over a bed of crisp marinated vegetables and fluffy white rice, 
          it offers a perfect balance of bold and refreshing flavors.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Rinse the rice thoroughly to remove any impurities. Drain well.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a small pot, combine the rice, a pinch of salt, and 1 cup of water. 
            Bring to a boil over high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 13 to 15 
            minutes until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn off the heat, fluff the rice with a fork, and keep it covered 
            to stay warm.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the rice cooks, wash and dry the fresh produce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Roughly chop the peanuts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peel and grate the carrots using the large side of a box grater.
          </li>
          <li>
            Halve the cucumber lengthwise and thinly slice crosswise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Thinly slice the scallions, keeping the white bottoms and green tops separate.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a bowl, combine the grated carrots, sliced cucumber, vinegar, sweet chili sauce, and 
            the white parts of the scallions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season with salt and pepper, stir to combine, and let marinate for at least 10 minutes, 
            stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter spread, curry paste, 
            mayonnaise, mirin, and 2 teaspoons of warm water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and place in a bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            Season with salt and pepper, then add the cornstarch and toss to coat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat a thin layer of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the oil is hot enough that a pinch of cornstarch sizzles immediately, add the 
            coated chicken in an even layer, discarding any excess cornstarch.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook without stirring for 3 to 4 minutes until lightly browned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Continue cooking, stirring frequently, for another 3 to 4 minutes until browned 
            and cooked through. Turn off the heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Discard any oil from the pan and transfer the cooked chicken to the bowl of 
            sauce, stirring to coat. Taste and season with salt and pepper if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the cooked rice topped with the marinated vegetables (including any liquid) 
            and the dressed chicken. Garnish with the chopped peanuts and the green tops of the scallions. Enjoy!
