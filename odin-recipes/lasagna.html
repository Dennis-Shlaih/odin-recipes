        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This lasagna is perfect for any occasion, and features a delightful cheesy filling. Instead of
          the traditional ricotta, this recipe uses a blend of 
          small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan for a unique twist. 
          Perfectly paired with a fresh green salad and crusty garlic 
          bread, this lasagna is a family favorite that never disappoints.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li> Gather all the ingredients and preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
          <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook and stir 
            the ground beef until it is browned and crumbly, which 
            should take about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain the grease, then 
            add the spaghetti sauce and let it simmer for 5 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>In a large bowl, mix together the cottage cheese, 2 cups 
            of mozzarella cheese, eggs, half of the grated Parmesan 
            cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>In a 9x13-inch baking dish, spread 3/4 cup of the sauce. 
            Layer with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of the 
            cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup of sauce. Repeat the layers 
            once more. Finish with the remaining 3 noodles, sauce, 
            mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup of water 
            along the edges of the dish and cover it tightly with 
            aluminum foil.
          </li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Then, uncover 
            and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Allow it to stand 
            for 10 minutes before serving.
